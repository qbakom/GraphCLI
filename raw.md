Project Specifications

1) Project in C

The project must be implemented strictly in the C programming language.

2) Console-based Graph Generation Program

Decide on a data structure for representing the graph.

The graph can be bidirectional.

Each vertex can have an arbitrary number of edges.

3) Two Types of Human-Computer Interaction

Structured input mode: Parameters are provided in an ordered manner upon program startup.

Example: Specify the number of vertices, whether the graph should be random or user-defined.

Chat-based input mode: Parameters are provided in natural language through a chat interface.

Example: "Create a graph with 5 vertices," "Generate a random graph."

Backend will act as AI.

4) Two Approaches to Graph Generation

Extract parameters from input data and generate the graph using an algorithm.

Generate the graph using LLM and adapt it to a specific representation.

Analyze the pros and cons of both approaches.

Implement at least one approach.

Present the graph in a textual format.

5) Data Validation

Ensure proper validation of input parameters to prevent errors and inconsistencies.

6) Output Format

The resulting graph should be saved in a predefined representation.

7) Additional Features

The project can be extended with additional features if needed.

8) Code Repository

The project should be uploaded to GitHub.
